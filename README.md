# autocompress
Simple video compressing script made with ffmpeg. Originally thought for recorded university classes.



## Usage
The script compresses everything contained in a `todo` directory, putting the output in a `elaborated` directory and the originals in a `original` direcory (see options for overrides). For flags, see
```sh
./autocompress.sh --help
```

You may override other options via environment variables. Directly see the script for such advanced overrides.
